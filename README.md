Analytical Fit to Experimental Luminescence Dose Response Curves
----------------------------------------------------------------
Optically-stimulated-luminescence (OSL) is widely used for archeological and geological dating.  As part of this process, various radiative doses are applied to a sample and luminescent intensity is measured.  This code provides a quick method for computing an analytical fit of luminescence-vs-dose based on a one-active-trap, one-deep-trap, one-luminescent-center model.

If the python script is executed, as is, it will perform a fit to sample data.  The script includes documentation.

For more information, including theoretical background and demonstration of the accuracy of the fit on nine quartz samples, see:
